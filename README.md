### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is RÃ©mi, I am 36 years old. I decided recently to do a professional retraining in web development. Here we can find projects I developped.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with "La Capsule" to make their website responsive, and to developp a new screen sharing feature for their professional plateform
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently developp for pleasure a landing page for the Repair Cafe hosted on a solar-power server with Gatsby's framework
- :sparkling_heart: I'm curious about making low-tech website

I used in my different project the following tools and frameworks:
-a headless cms (strapi)
-a WebRTC Server (Janus)
-Gatsby
-Express
-Node.JS
-Expo
-Github
-Bitbucket
