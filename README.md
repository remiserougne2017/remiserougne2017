### Hi there 👋

Hello, my name is Rémi, I am 36 years old. I decided recently to do a professional retraining in web development. Here we can find projects I developped.


- 🔭 I’m currently working with "La Capsule" to make their website responsive, and to developp a new screen sharing feature for their professional plateform
- 🌱 I’m currently working with Gatsby to create a landing page for the Repair Cafe hosted on a solar-power server
- :sparkling_heart: I'm curious about making low-tech website.
